    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p class="caption">a summary of the book</p>
    <p>Han Solo, frozen in carbonite, is held as a wall decoration in Jabba's Palace. C-3PO and R2-D2 then travel across Tatooine to rescue him, but soon discover that they are to be Jabba's servants. Leia then poses as a bounty hunter to come rescue Han,
      but becomes a slave to Jabba. Luke finally comes to barter for them, but is then thrown into the Rancor Pit, though he kills the rancor. This group of heroes, including the droids, are taken on Jabba's Barge, where they either serve him, or are
      to be executed. Here, there appears a small battle between the two sides, resulting in the death of all aboard the barge, including Jabba. Leia strangles Jabba to make her escape, and aids the final destruction of the barge. The group of heroes
      escape from this conflict, at last freed. <br /><br/> Luke then travels to Dagobah to complete his training with Yoda, only to find that Yoda is dying. He soon dies of old age. Between these two events, Vader and the Emperor meet to discuss Luke,
      and what to do with him. Emperor Palpatine seems to decide that he will dispose of Vader upon Luke's arrival, as Luke would be the stronger of the two. Vader seems to have an internal conflict between the two -Emperor Palpatine, his master and Luke
      Skywalker, his son - acting unsure of who he will side with if he will have to choose. The Rebels then plan their attack on the second Death Star, resulting in the mission to Endor.
      <br /><br /> The Rebels pilot the Tydirium, and are granted passage to Endor. Upon landing, Han, Chewbacca, Luke, Leia, and the droids are attacked by Imperial troopers. Boarding speeder bikes, they attempt to escape the troopers. One of them shoots
      toward Leia, knocking her off the bike. The others continue without notice of this incident, losing her. When Leia falls, she is knocked out, and wakes up to encounter Wicket, an Ewok. They befriend each other. The others encounter the Ewoks in
      a very different way, through being caught. Han, Luke, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 are caught by the Ewoks, who find them to be the enemy. They are convinced that C-3PO is a deity of some sort. They are taken to the Ewok village, and meet Leia once again.
      After C-3PO persuades the Ewoks to free the others, they &lpar;the Rebels and C-3PO&rpar; tell them of the Empire and the Rebel's travels. On the Death Star, during these encounters, the Emperor and Vader meet. Vader is sent to Endor to wait for
      Luke to come to him, as the Emperor says that he will. Leia and Luke briefly talk before Luke goes to meet Vader. Luke tells her that they are siblings, and how Vader is their father. Luke then tells her of his mission to meet Vader, and leaves
      her to meet him. <br /><br /> In the morning, the Rebels on Endor begin battling the Empire, with the Ewoks as a powerful ally. In the skies, the remaining Rebels begin to attack the Death Star, waiting for the shields to be taken out on Endor.
      They soon realize that, however, it is a trap.</p>

    <p>Here, Luke meets the Emperor and Vader. They try and tempt him toward the dark side, and to join them. They fail, as Luke refuses, telling them that he will never give in. Watching the Rebels fight, the Emperor says that they will fail. Luke disagrees,
      and is insistent that they will win the war against the Empire. <br /><br /> On Endor, the Rebels are continuing to fight against the Empire. Finally claiming the bunker powering the Death Star's shield, they destroy the shield, bringing the Rebel
      pilots to attack the Death Star. Meanwhile, on the Death Star, Vader and the Emperor continue trying to tempt Luke to join the dark side of the Force. The Emperor manages to bring Luke and Darth Vader into a fight, with the two of them battling
      in front of him. Vader seems to be stronger than Luke, nearly bringing him to his death, but Luke soon gains an upper hand, removing one of Vader's hands. The Emperor encourages him to finish, and kill Vader, though he refuses. Angering the Emperor,
      he &lpar;the Emperor&rpar; attacks Luke, but Vader soon picks up Palpatine, throwing him down a <span title="some sort of tube that is leading into unknown areas.">shaft</span>, killing him. Vader and Luke then leave, though Vader takes his final
      breath. They exit the Death Star just in time --- the Rebel pilots finally destroy the Death Star. Once Luke arrives at Endor, he burns Darth Vader's body. He then returns to the Rebels, and they and the Ewoks celebrate the Empire's destruction.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p class="caption">thoughts about the book</p>
    <p>I loved reading this Shakespearean adaptation of Return of the Jedi. I think that reading this put a different view on a story that is well known to myself and many others. The way that certain characters would talk was interesting, as Yoda seemed
      to speak in haikus, which I found unusual. I would recommend this book to anyone that's a fan of Star Wars and Shakespeare. Overall, I would give it 4.5/5 stars, as the Shakespearean dialogue did get confusing at times. <br /><small>*this is not an ad.</small></p>
